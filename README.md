# Ferum Standard Library

Move is an awesome langauge, but since the ecosystem is still early, it's missing some fundemental pieces. Ferum STD is our way of giving back to the community by open sourcing core components that we've built in house for everyone's use. If you have any questions or concerns, [join our discord](https://discord.gg/rk9T4MuppY) and also, [follow us on twitter](twitter.com/ferumxyz/) for updates.

## List of Modules

* [`ferum_std::fixed_point_64`](#fixed-point) â€” Ferum's implementation of FixedPoint, helping manage decimal points represented as integers.

## Installing

1\. Add `FerumSTD` in your [`Move.toml`](https://move-language.github.io/move/packages.html#movetoml) as a depdency following the example below:

```
[dependencies]
AptosFramework = { git = "https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core.git", subdir = "aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework/", rev = "devnet" }
FerumSTD = { git = "https://github.com/ferum-dex/ferum-std.git", rev = "main" }
```

Use `FerumSTD = { git = "https://github.com/ferum-dex/ferum-std.git", rev = "main" }` for mainnet and `FerumSTD = { git = "https://github.com/ferum-dex/ferum-std.git", rev = "devnet" }` for devnet.

2\. Run `aptos move compile`; sometimes you may need to run `aptos move clean`.

3\. Import a module and start using it. For example: &#x20;

```
use ferum_std::fixed_point_64::{Self, FixedPoint64};
...
let one = fixed_point_64::from_u64(1000, 3);
```

## Documentation
There are some quick examples below for each module, but if you want to see more extensive docs for all the functions, checkout our [Ferum Standard Library Docs](https://ferum.gitbook.io/ferum-standard-library/).

## Quick Examples 

### Fixed Point

```
use ferum_std::fixed_point_64::{Self, FixedPoint64};

/// Create fixed points from input.
let a = fixed_point_64::from_u64(1024, 3); // 1.024
let b = fixed_point_64::from_u64(2056, 2); // 20.56

// Compare two numbers
assert!(fixed_point_64::lte(a, b), 0);
assert!(!fixed_point_64::gte(a, b), 0);

// Get min/max of two fixed points.
let min = fixed_point_64::min(a, b);
let max = fixed_point_64::max(a, b);

// Perform addition / subtraction.
let added =  fixed_point_64::add(a, b);
let subtracted = fixed_point_64::sub(b, a);

// Perform multiplication / division with support for rounding up or truncating.
let multipliedRounded = fixed_point_64::multiply_round_up(a, a);
let multipliedTruncated = fixed_point_64::multiply_round_up(a, a);
let dividedRounded = fixed_point_64::divide_round_up(b, a);
let dividedTruncated = fixed_point_64::divide_trunc(b, a);

// Convert back to integers.
let au64 = fixed_point_64::to_u64(a, 3);
let bu64 = fixed_point_64::to_u64(b, 2);
```
