Move is an awesome langauge, but since the ecosystem is still early, it's missing some fundemental pieces. Ferum STD is our way of giving back to the community by open sourcing core components that we've built in house for everyone's use. If you have any questions or concerns, [join our discord](https://discord.gg/rk9T4MuppY) and don't [follow us on twitter](twitter.com/ferumxyz) for updates.
